</p><p>
Stack-based postfix code for expressions tend to be fairly inefficient<br>
as there is a lot of memory traffic. It is usually better to use<br>
registers to hold the values during expression evaluation.<br>
</p><p>
A simple way of achieving this is to use some of the registers for a<br>
small stack. To do this, you have to keep track of the stack-top<br>
pointer during compile time. Most expressions can be evaluated using<br>
only 4 registers, so you could simply reserve 4 registers for<br>
expression evaluation and "overflow" to memory when needed. If we<br>
assume that you use registers 0-3 for this, then<br>
expression-translation code could look like:<br>
</p><p>
    expression | compile-time actions | code<br>
-------------+----------------------+--------------------<br>
    x          | reg_no = reg_no+1    | load x to reg_no<br>
-------------+----------------------+--------------------<br>
    e1+e2      | compile e1;          |<br>
                          | compile e2;          |<br>
                          | reg_no = regno-1     | ADD reg_no reg_no+1<br>
</p><p>
Initially, reg_no is set to -1, so the first variable is loaded to<br>
register 0 (the actions are performed before the code is generated).<br>
To handle overflow, the actions should test if reg_no is greater than<br>
3 and then use some fixed memory locations based at adress BASE to<br>
hold the excess values.  The translation for variable x now becomes<br>
</p><p>
    reg_no = reg_no+1<br>
    if reg_no&lt;4 then<br>
        code = load x to reg_no<br>
    else<br>
        code = move x to BASE+(reg_no-4)*4   /* assume byte-addressing */<br>
</p><p>
For e1+e2 you have to distinguish three cases:<br>
</p><p>
  1) both arguments in registers<br>
  2) first argument in register, 2nd in memory<br>
  3) both arguments in memory.<br>
</p><p>
Note that you will need an auxiliary register for moving values from<br>
variables to memory locations and for doing arithmetic on values in<br>
memory. If you can't reserve a total of 5 registers for expression<br>
evaluation, you can reduce this to 4 by using only 3 for the stack.<br>
</p><p>
There are a few inefficiencies in the above strategy for using fixed<br>
registers and memory locations to hold stack values. For example, if<br>
the stack has overflowed to memory, then you first use a<br>
memory-to-memory move for getting a variable to the stack and then<br>
later take it from there to operate on it. It is better instead to<br>
take it directly from the variable loation when you need to operate on<br>
it. To achieve this, a "lazy" loading scheme can be used. In this, you<br>
don't load variables into registers or stack-slots until you need to<br>
operate on them, and at that point you exploit the x86 instructions<br>
that can take an argument from memory to avoid doing so in some of the<br>
cases.<br>
</p><p>
The idea is to keep a compile-time model of the stack, where the model<br>
for each stack-entry tells where the value can be found. This can be<br>
in a register, in a variable or in a memory-based stack slot.<br>
Additionally, you keep track of which registers and stack-slots hold<br>
values that are needed later on. When compiling a variable, no code is<br>
generated but the compile-time stack is updated to indicate that the<br>
stack-top is to be found in the variables location. When compiling<br>
(say) an addition, the generated code depends on where the operands<br>
are found:<br>
</p><p>
  1) If one operand is in a register and the other in memory, an<br>
        instruction that adds the memory-contents to the register is<br>
        generated and the compile-time stack description is updated to<br>
        indicate that the new stack-top is in the register.<br>
</p><p>
  2) If both arguments are in registers, a prely register-based<br>
        addition instruction is generated using one register as both<br>
        operand and destination and the register description now indicates<br>
        that the register holding the other operand is free. The<br>
        compile-time stack is updated as indicated above.<br>
</p><p>
  3) If both arguments are in memory, a register for doing the<br>
        operation needs to be found. We hence look in the register<br>
        description for a free register, mark it as used and load one<br>
        operand into this and proceed as in case 1. If no free register is<br>
        available, one is made so by moving a register to memory. The<br>
        compile-time stack is updated to reflect the new location of the<br>
        stack element that used to be in the register (hence, the register<br>
        description must also record which stack element is held in a used<br>
        register).<br>
