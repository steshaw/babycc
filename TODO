* add char type - do automatic extension on load and parameter passing
  to int (this will make it easy)

Todo items from Crenshaw tutorials:

o Basic types, such as character and integer types

o Arrays

o Strings

o User-defined types and structures

o Tree-structured parsers and intermediate languages

o Optimization

Other items:

o Get Pascal creator's Niklaus Wirth compiler book again (it has the idea of 
  lazy emission of instructions and combining them in the stream before
  they are written. "Wirthian compilers" are known to be fast and produce
  code comparable with those using an IL).

o Check out John's dcode again - it may be useful for structuring
  retargetable code emission.

o Boolean representation. There is no choice for C: false is 0 and
  true is non-zero and usually 1. A better choice may be 0 for false
  and -1 for true since bitwise not of -1 or 0 (and vice versa).
